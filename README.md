- ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks! Iâ€™m @leo-dev48, an Italo-Peruvian guy (he/him) born at the end of the 90s, based near Genoa (until now).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology (you wouldn't have said that, right?) among many others things like RTS games, movies, animes and similiar nerdy topics as well as walking, listening to latino-american music and to people who have something interesting to speak about.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm following a BSc degree in Computer Science @UniGe, hoping to end it ASAP the best i can. Loads of ideas for the future but haven't decided what to do next yet, so I'm open to new ideas.
- Looking forward to be inspired!
