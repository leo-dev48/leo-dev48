- ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks! Iâ€™m @leo-dev48, an Italo-Peruvian guy born at the end of the 90s, based in Genoa (until now).
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm following a BSc degree in Computer Science @UniGe, hoping to end it ASAP the best i can. Loads of ideas for the future but haven't decided what to do next yet, so I'm open to new ideas.
- Looking forward to be inspired!
