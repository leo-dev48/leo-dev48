- ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks! Iâ€™m @leo-dev48, an Italo-Peruvian guy (he/him) born at the end of the 90s, based near Genoa (until now).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology (you wouldn't have said that, right?) among many others things like RST games, movies, animes and similiar nerdy topics as well as walking, talking and listening to people who have something interesting to speak about.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently following a BSc degree in Computer Science @UniGe, hoping to end it ASAP the best i can. Loads of ideas for the future but haven't decided what to do next yet.
